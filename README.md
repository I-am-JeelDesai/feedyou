# FeedYOU

By Jeel J. Desai

## Status
This project is currently in beta and the user interface (UI) is still under development. I am working to convert the UI to Material You 3, which is a new design language from Google that allows for more personalized and dynamic experiences. I will provide updates on the progress of this work as it becomes available. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

FeedYOU is an open-source project that I developed as part of my college project. I am continuing to update it with new features and improvements. The project is still in beta, so I am always open to feedback.
